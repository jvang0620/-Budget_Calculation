# Budget Calculation Project

This Java project was my first application developed while learning the fundamentals of Java programming. Initially, I considered not including it in my portfolio, but I decided to showcase it as a way to highlight my progress over time. This project demonstrates basic input and output handling, mathematical calculations, and use of variables in Java.

## Project Description

The **Budget Calculation** program simulates a basic budgeting scenario for a student. It takes into account various monthly expenses, calculates the total cost, and determines how many hours the student needs to work at a given hourly wage to cover these expenses. Additionally, it calculates the total hours required if the student wants to save an extra $100 each month.

This project serves as a foundational exercise, showcasing basic Java concepts such as:

- Declaring and using variables.
- Performing arithmetic operations.
- Using `System.out.println()` to display outputs.
- Implementing basic logical flow and calculations.

## Features

- Calculate total monthly expenses for a student.
- Determine the number of hours the student needs to work to break even.
- Compute the additional hours needed if the student aims to save $100 a month after covering expenses.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory where `Budget.java` is located.
3. Compile the program using the command:
   ```bash
   javac project1/Budget.java
   ```
4. Run the program using the command:

   ```bash
   java project1.Budget
   ```

   ### Example Output

   ```bash
   The hourly wage is 10 dollars.
   The monthly rent is 625 dollars.
   The monthly internet service is 27 dollars.
   The monthly grocery expense is 250 dollars.
   The monthly fun allowance is 150 dollars.
   The total monthly expenses are 1052.0 dollars.
   The total hours the student needs to work to break even is 105.2 hours.
   The total hours the student will have to work to include an additional savings of $100 per month after paying all expenses are 115.2 hours.
   ```

## Future Enhancements

While this project served as an introductory exercise, several enhancements can be made to improve it:

1. **User Input**: Allow users to input their own expenses and hourly wage instead of using hard-coded values.
2. **Additional Expenses**: Expand the program to include more detailed expenses such as transportation, utilities, and miscellaneous costs.
3. **GUI Implementation**: Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to make the application more interactive and user-friendly.
4. **Data Persistence**: Save and load expense data from a file for easy modifications and record-keeping.

## Final Thoughts

This project may be simple, but it represents an important step in my journey to becoming a proficient Java developer. Including this in my portfolio allows others to see where I started and how my skills have grown since then.
